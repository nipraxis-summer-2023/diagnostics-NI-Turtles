**Project Analysis Plan**

- **Literature Review:**
  - Conduct thorough research on outlier detection methods in fMRI data preprocessing.
  - Document findings collaboratively in a shared Google Doc.

- **Method Selection:**
  - Choose outlier detection methods (besides mean and DVARS) based on research findings.
  - Evaluate the suitability of selected methods for the dataset.

- **Code Implementation:**
  - Develop Python scripts to implement chosen outlier detection methods.
  - Include clear docstrings to facilitate code understanding.

- **Testing Framework:**
  - Create test scripts to validate method functionality using sample data and expected outcomes.

- **Generalization Assessment:**
  - Apply outlier detection methods to a similar dataset to assess their generality and adaptability.

- **Method Decision:**
  - Evaluate method performance and decide whether to use the best-performing method or employ an ensemble (bagging) of methods for robustness.

- **README.md Setup:**
  - Write a comprehensive README.md file with clear instructions for code setup and execution.
  - Ensure reproducibility for others by providing detailed steps.

- **Reproducibility Test:**
  - Verify that your code is fully reproducible by external users following the README.md instructions.

- **Collaboration and Transparency:**
  - Foster effective collaboration on GitHub through branches, commits, and pull requests.
  - Maintain transparency in project interactions and documentation.

- **Argument Clarity:**
  - Document your reasoning for identifying outliers in a separate file.
  - Explain why scans are considered outliers and provide educated hypotheses about the underlying causes.

- **Impact Assessment:**
  - Evaluate the influence of outlier removal on statistical testing for the experimental model.
  - Showcase improvements in statistical results post-outlier removal.

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Keep channels open for team communication and be responsive to feedback.
  - Adapt the analysis plan and code as needed based on insights and project developments.
